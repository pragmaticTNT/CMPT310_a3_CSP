Assignment 3 Edits
==============================================================
Sure there are no error he says, it compiles fine he says
well whatever his magical computer power are I am not capable 
of reproducing such wizardry, so below is a list of fixes.
==============================================================
1. (global.h) Lines 15:17
	Add int type to const variables VAR, DOMS, N

2. (stack_two.cc) Lines multiple
	All instances where of calling new on a int pointer
	have had their parenthesis removed. This is due
	to the newer version of g++. WARNING: this might 
	not actually work, as several bug reports show
	that this might be an ongoing issue. E.g
		stack2 = (int **) new (int*)[k]; //became:
		stack2 = (int **) new int*[k]

3. (constraint.cc) Lines multiple 
	See 2.

4. (network.cc) Lines multiple
	See 2. 

5. (timer_2.cc) Lines 2
	Add int type to MAXSTRING. See 1.

6. (limit.cc) Line 33
	Add void return type of function  set_limit

7. (limit.cc) Line 11
	Nope, in the function expire(...) get rid of the ellipes and add an int variable.
	everything else should be fine so yes in line 55 it IS expire.
	
8. (sfs.cc) Line 5
	See 5. 
9. (solve.cc) Line 16
	Some function member calls are wrong. Do this and 10
		(this->*method)(solution, 1, number, found);
10. (main.cc & main.all.cc) all member function call of the form: M.method (e.g. M.BT)
		M.solve(M.BT, S, 1, &found); // original
		M.solve(&NETWORK::BT, S, 1, &found); //fixed
